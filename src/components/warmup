# ALL WE DID IN THIS WARMUP IS
- made two Viewpages, connected them to the router file
- then made a button component, that called the api and set the cookies
- then we added the button component to the advice page
  where we get the cookie to display the api content on the page when clicked




1. Create a vue project named api_advice, connect to GitHub
  1.1. Ensure you select Router during setup
  1.2. Ensure you install axios and vue-cookies after setup
2. Configure your debugger
3. Clean your project so you have a clean routing file, no views, no components and a clean App.vue file
  3.1. Use the slides as a guide here so you know what to remove and what not to
4. Create a new view named HomePage, go through the workflow to declare this view with the path of "/"
  4.1. No need for meta data on this one, just a simple view is fine
5. Create a new view named AdvicePage, go through the workflow to declare this view with the path of "/advice"
  5.1. No need for meta data on this one, just a simple view is fine
6. Create a component called AdivceButton, use it in the HomePage
  6.1. When it is clicked, make an axios request to the url `https://api.adviceslip.com/advice`
  6.2. On success: 
    6.2.1 Store the advice in a cookie called advice
    6.2.2. Send the user to the AdvicePage
  6.3. On failure, show the user a simple error message
7. On the AdvicePage: 
  7.1. Give the user a link to go back to the HomePage
  7.2. Read from the cookies and show the user the advice retrieved from the API
  7.3. If there is no cookie, show the user a typical error message
